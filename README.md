## LeetCode Solutions ‚úÖ

LeetCode is an online algorithm judging platform for engineers and mathmatcians to practice their problem solving abilities. Practicing LeetCode is known to help with passing technical interviews and can greatly increase algorithmic skills. Each solution is paired with a test file and README to understand the solution and overall problem. See below for an updated list of the solved problems in this repo.

## Data Structures üèõ
Data Structures or `DS` are key to understanding the fundmentals of programming. They teach us how data is stored, retrieved, and updated. In this repository, the following data structures are written: linked list, tree, stack, queue,  graph, and heap. Each data structure implementation comes with a test file as well as a README to reinforce the learnings.
