## Linked List

The linked list data structure contains nodes in a sequential sequence. Each node consists of two memory locations, a data pointer and a next pointer. The LL DS itself is not super awesome by themselves but instead you can think of them as an essential building block to create other amazing data structures such as queues, stacks, and even graphs.

This list features head, tail, and size attributes and methods to create and modify the data structure. 

In this implementation, the following operations are supported:
1. append node to end of linked list
2. prepend node to start of linked list
3. insert node after given position
4. insert node before given poistion
5. pop at end of list
6. pop at start of list
7. remove at given position
8. clear list
9. getters of attributes
10. to string method
