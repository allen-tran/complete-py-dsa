# Bubble Sort

- Quadratic time complexity: O(N^2)

We go through the array and with each iteration, we try to find the j-i-1'th highest number and make it bubble up. The nested loops ensures that each number is considered and all of the proceeeding sub iterations move the highest numbers up as far as the can go.
